Over the years we have collected many items that people left behind or forgot on our campsite. Look through the window or come inside: you might recognize something.

Meet Valère, the self-proclaimed “Responsible for the lost and found office”! He has made his life’s work of sorting items, labelling them and looking for the rightful owner. He has promised to be present and to answer all your questions during the guided tours.
