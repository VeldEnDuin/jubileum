It was the ultimate wish of Fernand’s parents to keep a part of the cornfield as a constant reminder of how the campsite used to be. And then all of a sudden we received this telephone call... pick up the receiver and listen.

You can find [the Queen’s recipe](#mx-2) in the telephone booth or among the bonus material.

Nice to know: this is the [authentic recipe](https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2011/nr11-116.html) for the scones the Queen served when she welcomed President Eisenhower in August 1959.
